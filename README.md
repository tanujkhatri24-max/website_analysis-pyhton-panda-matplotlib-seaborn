# üåê Website Performance Analysis

## Brief Summary
Analyzing website traffic and performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and suggest improvements.

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing website performance using Python.  
I collected and processed website data to evaluate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as page load time, bounce rate, and user engagement.  
The analysis helps identify areas for optimization and improved user experience.

## Problem Statement/solved
Many websites face performance issues due to slow loading, unoptimized content, and poor traffic management.  
This project aims to detect these issues using data analytics and provide actionable insights.
1) What patterns or trends can you observe in website sessions and users over
time?
2) Which marketing channel brought the highest number of users to the website,
and how can we use this insight to improve traffic from other sources?
3) Which channel has the highest average engagement time, and what does that
tell us about user behavior and content effectiveness?
4) Which channels are driving more engaged sessions compared to non-engaged
ones, and what strategies can improve engagement in underperforming
channels?
5) At what hours of the day does each channel drive the most traffic?
6) Is there any correlation between high traffic (sessions) and high engagement
rate over time?


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes website traffic metrics such as page views, session duration, bounce rate, and traffic sources.  

  
- Pandas (Data cleaning and analysis)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
- seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Insights
- Identified pages with the slowest load times  
- Found correlation between bounce rate and page load speed  
- Peak traffic times analyzed to optimize server load  
- Suggested improvements for mobile and desktop user experience

## **How to Run**
1. Download or clone this repository  
2. Open the notebook file `Website_Performance.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**  
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and charts  

## Result and Conclusion
- Key bottlenecks and performance issues identified  
- Recommendations provided for page optimization and traffic management  
- Improved understanding of website analytics and data-driven decision making
