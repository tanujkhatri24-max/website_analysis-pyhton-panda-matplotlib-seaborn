# üåê Website Performance Analysis

## Brief Summary
Analyzing website traffic and performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and suggest improvements.

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing website performance using Python.  
I collected and processed website data to evaluate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as page load time, bounce rate, and user engagement.  
The analysis helps identify areas for optimization and improved user experience.

## Problem Statement
Many websites face performance issues due to slow loading, unoptimized content, and poor traffic management.  
This project aims to detect these issues using data analytics and provide actionable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes website traffic metrics such as page views, session duration, bounce rate, and traffic sources.  


## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas (Data cleaning and analysis)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
- seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Insights
- Identified pages with the slowest load times  
- Found correlation between bounce rate and page load speed  
- Peak traffic times analyzed to optimize server load  
- Suggested improvements for mobile and desktop user experience

## **How to Run**
1. Download or clone this repository  
2. Open the notebook file `Website_Performance.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**  
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and charts  

## Result and Conclusion
- Key bottlenecks and performance issues identified  
- Recommendations provided for page optimization and traffic management  
- Improved understanding of website analytics and data-driven decision making
